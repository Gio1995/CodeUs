# CodeUs
CodeUs is a project create to write code together with friends and colleagues, or for educational purposes.
The idea was born from the need to write code with my friend Amy in real time without the use of usbdrive, the cloud, or any other support to share files.
And so with this site we can have a personal profile with us projects,
